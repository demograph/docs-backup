\section{Monotonic}

Monotonic is a computational model where one can describe datastructures and operations, most of which are monotonic.

\section{Reactors}

Reactors lifts the classic actor model to a new level. The actor model is imperative and significant effort is required to move from the primitives of message passing to a system where common higher order compositions are easy. Reactors builds on top of the actor model, enjoying the benefits it provides, while enabling typical compositions using functional-reactive combinators.

The basic abstractions in the reactor model are: reactor, channels and event streams. These abstractions have an analogue in the classical actor model, actor, actor-reference and actor-event-handling-loop respectively.
