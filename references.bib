abstract = {Economists claim that principles of rationality are normative principles. Nevertheless, they go on to explain why it is in a persons own interest to be rational. If this were true, being rational itself would be a means to an end, and rationality could be interpreted in a non-normative or naturalistic way. The alternative is not attractive: if the only argu- ment in favor of principles of rationality were their intrinsic appeal, a commitment to rationality would be irrational, making the notion of rationality self-defeating. A com- prehensive conception of rationality should recommend itself: it should be rational to be rational. Moreover, since rational action requires rational beliefs concerning means-ends relations, a naturalistic conception of rationality has to cover rational belief formation in- cluding the belief that it is rational to be rational. The paper considers four conceptions of rationality and asks whether they can deliver the goods: Bayesianism, perfect ratio- nality (just in case that it differs from Bayesianism), ecological rationality (as a version of bounded rationality), and critical rationality, the conception of rationality characterizing critical rationalism. The answer is summarized in the papers title.},

annote = {SWB is multifaceted. 

Subjective well-being is influenced by situations and circumstances. In contrast with the idea that:
1) our experience of wellbeing adapts itself to circumstances, while running on the wheel to make improvements, our experience doesn't really change.
2) well-being is mostly fixed by genetical heritage. It is true that this is a factor of the equation, but it certainly isn't the only one.

Higher SWB reduces suffering from infirmities and contributes to an average longer life. Such individuals are more likely to enact healthy behaviors such as exercising, not smoking and wearing seat belts. Higher SWB correlates with stronger immune and cardiovascular systems. The cardiovascular system returns to baseline faster after a stressful experience.

Social relationships

Interventions to raise SBW can be effectful

Low income inequality leads to higher SWB, progressive taxation},

@article{Tay2011,
abstract = {Across a sample of 123 countries, we examined the association between the fulfillment of needs and subjective well-being (SWB), including life evaluation, positive feelings, and negative feelings. Need fulfillment was consistently associated with SWB across world regions. Life evaluation was most associated with fulfilling basic needs; positive feelings were most associated with social and respect needs; and negative feelings were most associated with basic, respect, and autonomy needs. Societal need fulfillment predicted SWB, particularly for life evaluation, beyond individuals' fulfillment of their own needs, indicating the desirability of living in a flourishing society. In addition, the associations of SWB with the fulfillment of specific needs were largely independent of whether other needs were fulfilled. These trends persisted when household income was taken into account. The emergent ordering of need fulfillment for psychosocial needs were fairly consistent across country conditions, but the fulfillment of basic and safety needs were contingent on country membership.},
