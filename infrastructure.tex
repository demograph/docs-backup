\section{Open Data Infrastructure}

Demograph builds on top of an Open Data Infrastructure, called Monotonic. Monotonic enables users to store, change and exchange data with other devices and users. The infrastructure is open in that anyone can participate without incurring any fees.

Monotonic is composed of several components. It handles user authentication and authorization. It ensures connectivity in the face of churn and network partitions. It enables users to bind a schema to namespace and to store data in the namespace in line with that schema. Namespaces can be subscribed to, and being subscribed implies that updates are replicated to machines you are active on. Your updates in turn are replicated to other parties with interest. Let's have a look at these components in detail.
